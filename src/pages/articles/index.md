      I'm a frontend developer and co-founder of [Navillus](https://navillus.dev), a software studio and think tank. In a hurry? My [notes](/notes) also get syndicated to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tonysull_co), [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@tonysull), and an [RSS feed](https://tonysull.co/articles/feed.xml) if that's your thing!
